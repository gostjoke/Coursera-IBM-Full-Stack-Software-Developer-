docker pull hello-world

# Verify that that the container has been removed. Run the following command.
docker ps -a

docker container rm <container_id>

docker build . -t myimage:v1

docker images

docker run -dp 8080:8080 myimage:v1

curl localhost:8080

docker stop $(docker ps -q)


######
The environment should have already logged you into the IBM Cloud account that has been automatically generated for you by the Skills Network Labs environment. 
The following command will give you information about the account youâ€™re targeting:

ibmcloud target


#####
The environment also created an IBM Cloud Container Registry (ICR) namespace for you. 
Since Container Registry is multi-tenant, namespaces are used to divide the registry among several users.
Use the following command to see the namespaces you have access to:

ibmcloud cr namespaces


#####
Ensure that you are targeting the region appropriate to your cloud account, 
for instance us-south region where these namespaces reside as you saw in the output of the ibmcloud target command.

ibmcloud cr region-set us-south

#####
Log your local Docker daemon into IBM Cloud Container Registry so that you can push to and pull from the registry.
ibmcloud cr login

#####
Export your namespace as an environment variable so that it can be used in subsequent commands.

export MY_NAMESPACE=sn-labs-$USERNAME


##### 
Tag your image so that it can be pushed to IBM Cloud Container Registry.

docker tag myimage:v1 us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/hello-world:1

#####
Push the newly tagged image to IBM Cloud Container Registry.

docker push us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/hello-world:1
docker push us.icr.io/sn-labs-tienweih/hello-world:1

######
Verify that the image was successfully pushed by listing images in Container Registry.
ibmcloud cr images


####
Optionally, to only view images within a specific namespace.
ibmcloud cr images --restrict $MY_NAMESPACE
